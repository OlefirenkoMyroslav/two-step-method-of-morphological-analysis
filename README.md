# two-step-method-of-morphological-analysis

In this work, a structured analysis was performed on various factors influencing pawnshop robberies. Using Python and the pandas library, a comprehensive parameter space was defined, consisting of categorical features such as time of robbery, presence of weapons, number of criminals, and other situational conditions.

Each category was assigned a base probability, and a correlation matrix was created to represent pairwise dependencies between parameter values. The pandas library was used to manage and manipulate the structured data efficiently, enabling analysis of combinations of conditions and their adjusted probabilities. This setup lays the foundation for further modeling and simulation of robbery scenarios based on both independent and correlated parameters.
